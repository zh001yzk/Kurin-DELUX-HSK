This mod is fan-made continuation of [Kurin, The Three Tailed Fox]. I do not own (or claim to own) original resources of [Kurin, Three Tailed Fox] mod. Creators of [Kurin, Three Tailed Fox] mod are shown on its workshop page.
I waited for Dalrae, but since he dosen't give a fuck about rimworld and his kurins, I wanted to play with kurins, and I made a lot of content for them.
Art assets of dragonians and kurins belong to Kuro, I don't see any ploblem to use in KTTFDE assets from KTTFI3A, even if KTTFI3A is add-on, anyways I have got a permission to use dragonians' stuff in KTTFI3A, so it's equal to KTTFDE. Yes. Dont ask me why they ever exist. I took textures from Kuro's mod (with a permission) for alteration another Kuro's mod, so there is no any debatable stuff.

Creation of this mod took me far too long I fucking swear. I fucking HATE rimworld modding, but the result is worth the suffering.

Note: I almost didn't change the original kurin backstories. However I made a lot of new lore about kurins.

KTTFDE offers:

	The Kurin species, evolved, but untamed. Original kurins were created by Dalrae and Kuro (and others)
	Hi-resolution textures. Textures of KTTFDE are 512x512. DDS-textures support included
	Facial animations that are similar to animations of original mod. Optional, if you use [[NL] Facial Animation - WIP]
	2 kurin shuttles. Optional, if you use [SRTSE]
	A storyteller - Momoka Modest. High desired population. High event appearance rate
	Kurin quests / incidents
	A custom kurin ending
	High-tech production buildings - kurin fabricators
	Custom kurin settelment trader; 4 kurin caravan traders (standart, illegal, food, medical)

Kurins of KTTFDE have two genders. Female-only kurin clothes (dresses) won't appear on male kurins by pawn generator.
Kurins of KTTFDE have 4 colors of eyes: vanilla brown, green, blue, black. If you use facial animations mod, there are more colors of the eyes.
In original kurin mod naked kurins had panties, but kurins of KTTFDE have completely naked body texture.
All KTTFDE weapon has unique sounds from various games, kurin weapons worth their creation with their stats.

Kurins of KTTFDE have:

	15% bonus to eating speed, cook speed, resesearch speed, immunity gain speed
	30% bonus to negotiation ability and social impact
	increased pawn beauty, trade price improvement, melee dodge chance
	increased by 30% psychic sensitivity
	increased by 30% toxic sensitivity
	decreased by 30% plant work speed and mining speed
	decreased by 100% pawn trap spring chance

Kurins of KTTFDE don't get these thoughts/moods:

	Ate Without of Table (bruh)
	Environment Dark (they like nights as well as they were engineered with fox genes)

After any self-completed mental brake kurins will be regret about what they have done, so they will try to be more useful for their colony, and in return they will be more productive (inspiration after the mental brake).
There are exactly 3 tails attached to kurin body (in original kurin mod there was only one).
There is a patch for [VFE Production] (VFE's tailor cabinet can be linkable of kurin tailoring bench). There is a patch for [VAE Accessories] (kurin power armor gets verbs and can launch various grenades). There is a patch for [VGP Garden Fabrics] (kurin tailoring bench gets recycling clothes). There is a patch for [Yayo's Combat 3 [Adopted]] (scenarios get some ammo). There is a patch for [DE Surgeries].
If you use Dragonian livestock mod, kurin caravans will have dragonians as carrier animals.
There is another species into the mod - kimiri. Kimiris are genetically engineered by kurins. They were created to do that kurins don't like to do. Kimiris have strong body, they have very low toxic sensitivity, low flammability and the same negotiation ability and social impact as kurins have. Also they have bonuses to eating speed, immunity gain speed, mining, managing with animals and plants growing. On the other hand they have very low research speed and decreased global learning factor.

[Harmony] is required.

Do not remove Republic Of Kurin at world creation!

This mod is incompatible with [Kurin HAR Edition].

If you want to have right hats rendering, you should use [Dubs Apparel Tweaks] mod. Enable "Show hair under hats" and if you have facial animation mod - "Alternate hair draw mode (for conflicts)" in its mod settings. Also set "Hair layer offset" to -0.001. After ALL of this your rendering of hats should work right.

For correct working of KTTFDE, in the mod list it has to be loaded AFTER Humanoid Alien Race Framework. If you use Facial Animation mod, don't forget to place it BEFORE of Humanoid Alien Race Framework in the mod list, also don't forget to place Dubs Apparel Tweaks AFTER Facial Animation mod in the mod list. Also if you use SRTSE, don't forget to place it BEFORE of KTTFDE in the mod list. Also if you use Dragonian livestock mod, don't forget to place it BEFORE of KTTFDE in the mod list.

You may use [Hats Display Selection] or [[KV] Show Hair With Hats or Hide All Hats] instead of [Dubs Apparel Tweaks] and ignore a warning. I highly recommend to use what I have already used/checked, however that mods can do the same as Apparel Tweaks can too.

Kimiris are tanky, cute, but moreover they are hermaphrodites a.k.a dudes with cute female voice, boobs and DICK in the groin area. They have a pussy too, but who cares, if you are attracted to kimiri, you are GAY in any case, AHAHAHHAHHHAHAHAHAHHAH
